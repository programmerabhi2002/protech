                            Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language
                            intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
                            the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                            <br><br>
                            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                            As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
                            programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<br>

                    <h4><b style="font-weight:600" id="hi">Lets know more about history of Java-</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead"> <b> Java was originally developed by James Gosling at
                            <i> Sun Microsystems</i> (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in
                            1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
                            The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
                            machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost
                            all Linux distributions.
                            <br>
                            As of September 2020, the latest version is Java 15, with Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are
                            still receiving security and other upgrades.<br>
                            Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 15) or an
                            LTS release.<br>

                            <a href="/wiki/James_Gosling" title="James Gosling" class="text-dark">James Gosling</a> Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
                            ava was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
                            The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.
                            Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
                            <br>
                            Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.
                            <br>
                            On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Principles</strong><br>
                            There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:-
                            <br>
                            <strong>1)</strong> It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.<br>
                            <strong>2)</strong> It must be robust and secure.<br>
                            <strong>3)</strong> It must be architecture-neutral and portable.<br>
                            <strong>4)</strong> It must execute with high performance.<br>
                            <strong>5)</strong> It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.<br>

                                <li>Java is easy to learn.<br>
                                    Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.</li>
                                <li> Java is object-oriented.<br>
                                    This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.</li>
                                <li>Java is platform-independent.<br>
                                    One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to another. The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels. </li>
                                <li>Java is cheap and economical to maintain.<br>
                                    Java programs are cheap to develop and maintain as these programs are dependent on a specific hardware infrastructure to run. We can easily execute them on any machine that reduces the extra cost to maintain.</li>
                                <li> Java is a high-level programming language<br>
                                    Java is a high-level programming language as it is a human-readable language. It is similar to human language and has a very simple and easy to maintain syntax that is similar to the syntax of C++ language but in a simpler manner.</li>
                                <li> Java supports Multithreading<br>
                                    Java is a multithreaded language that is in Java more than one thread can run at the same time. A thread is the smallest unit of a process. Multithreading helps us to gain the maximum utilization of CPU. Multiple threads share a common memory area and increase the efficiency and performance of the application. These threads run independently of each other without affecting each other.</li>
                                <li>Java provides an efficient memory allocation strategy<br>Java has an efficient memory allocation strategy as it divides the memory mainly in two parts- Heap Area and Stack Area. The JVM provides us the memory space for any variable either from the heap area or the stack area. Whenever we declare a variable JVM gives memory from either stack or heap space. </li>

                            <b>
                                <li> Java is slow and has a poor performance<br>Java is memory-consuming and significantly slower than native languages such as C or C++. It is also slow compared to other languages like C and C++ because each code has to be interpreted to the machine level code. This slow performance is due to the extra level of compilation and abstraction by the JVM. Moreover, sometimes the garbage collector leads in the poor performance of Java as it consumes more CPU time. </li>
                                <li>Java provides not so attractive look and feels of the GUI<br> Though there are many GUI builders in Java for creating the graphical interface still they are not suitable for creating complicated UI. There are many inconsistencies while using them. There are many popular frameworks such as Swing, SWT, JavaFX, JSF for creating GUI. But they are not mature enough to develop a complex UI. Choosing one of them which can be suitable for you may require additional research.</li>
                                <li> Java provides no backup facility<br>Java mainly works on storage and not focuses on the backup of data. This is a major drawback that makes it lose the interest and ratings among users. </li>
                                <li>Java requires significant memory space<br>Java requires a significant or major amount of memory space as compared to other languages like C and C++. During the execution of garbage collection, the memory efficiency and the performance of the system may be adversely affected. </li>
                                <li> Verbose and Complex codes<br>Java codes are verbose, meaning that there are many words in it and there are many long and complex sentences that are difficult to read and understand. This can reduce the readability of the code. Java focuses on being more manageable but at the same time, it has to compromise it with the overly complex codes and long explanations for each thing. </li>

                                in keeping pace with enterprise demands.
                                <br>
                                Now, Java EE has a new home and a new brand. The project was migrated from Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation, and it is called Jakarta EE, under the Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) project. The Eclipse Foundation released Jakarta EE 8 on September 10, and in this article, we’ll
                                look at what that means for enterprise Java.
                                <br>
                                Java EE was a very strong project that was widely used in many kinds of enterprise Java applications and many big frameworks, such as Spring and Struts. Developers may have questioned its features and evolving processes, but looking at its high usage and time in the market, its success is undeniable. Nonetheless, the enterprise world doesn’t stop, and new challenges emerge all the time. The speed of change has increased, with new technologies such as cloud computing being developed to provide better solutions,
                                and Java EE needed to keep pace as well.
                                <br>
                                <strong style="font-size:25px">Jakarta EE goals</strong><br>

                                The Java ecosystem has a new focus on cloud computing, and Jakarta EE is key to that approach. Jakarta EE’s goal is to accelerate business application development for cloud computing (cloud-native applications), working with specifications developed by many vendors. This project is based on Java EE 8, and its specifications, Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs), and Reference Implementations (RI) were all migrated from Oracle
                                to the Eclipse Foundation.<br>
                                To evolve these specifications for cloud computing, however, we cannot work with the same processes used on Java EE, because they are too slow for current enterprise challenges. Thus, the Eclipse Foundation’s first action was to change the process to evolve Jakarta EE.
                                <br>
                                The Jakarta EE 8 has the same set of specifications from Java EE 8 with no changes in its features. The only change is the new process to evolve these specifications. With this, Jakarta EE 8 is a milestone in Java enterprise history, as it inserts these specifications in a new process to boost the specifications to a cloud-native application approach.
                                <br>
                                Jakarta EE 8 marks a new era in the Java ecosystem; it gets the important Java EE project working under an open source process and paves the way for needed improvements. Although this Jakarta EE version comes without feature updates, it opens the gate to new features to come in the future. So, we’ll see many solutions based on specifications for cloud development in the next versions of Jakarta EE.

                    <h4>Syntax</h4>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <b>
                            The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.
                            All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons.
                            Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).
                            <br>
                            Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.
                            <br>
                            Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different
                            styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//),
                            a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the
                            Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */.
                            The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc
                            executable to create documentation for the program and can be read
                            by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to
                            allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.

                    <h5>Java Applet</h5>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <b>
                            Java applets were small applications written in the Java programming language, or another programming language that compiles to Java bytecode, and delivered to users in the form of Java bytecode.
                            <br>
                            The user launched the Java applet from a web page, and the applet was then executed within a Java virtual machine (JVM) in a process separate from the web browser itself. A Java applet could appear in a frame of the web page, a new application window, Sun's AppletViewer, or a stand-alone tool for testing applets.
                            <br>
                            Java applets were introduced in the first version of the Java language, which was released in 1995. Beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology applets used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015–2017. Java applets were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017
                            and removed from Java SE 11 (18.9), released in September 2018.
                            <br>
                            Java applets run at very fast speeds and until 2011, they were many times faster than JavaScript. Unlike JavaScript, Java applets had access to 3D hardware acceleration, making them well-suited for non-trivial, computation-intensive visualizations. As browsers have gained support for hardware-accelerated graphics thanks to the canvas technology
                            (or specifically WebGL in the case of 3D graphics),as well as just-in-time compiled JavaScript,
                            the speed difference has become less noticeable.<br>
                            Since Java bytecode is cross-platform (or platform independent), Java applets can be executed by browsers (or other clients) for many platforms, including Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, Unix, macOS and Linux. They cannot be run on modern mobile devices, which do not support Java.

                        <b>
                            A Java Servlet (formerly Jakarta Servlet) is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. Although servlets can respond to many types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API. Such web servlets are the Java counterpart to
                            other dynamic web content technologies such as PHP and ASP.NET.
                            <br>
                            A Servlet is an object that receives a request and generates a response based on that request. The basic Servlet package defines Java objects to represent servlet requests and responses, as well as objects to reflect the servlet's configuration parameters and execution environment. The package javax.servlet.http defines HTTP-specific subclasses of the generic servlet elements, including session management objects that track multiple requests and responses between the web server and a client. Servlets may be packaged in a WAR file as a web application.
                            Servlets can be generated automatically from Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) by the Jakarta Server Pages compiler. The difference between servlets and JSP is that servlets typically embed HTML inside Java code, while JSPs embed Java code in HTML. While the direct usage of servlets to generate HTML (as shown in the example below) has become rare, the higher level MVC web framework in Jakarta EE (JSF) still explicitly uses the servlet technology for the low level request/response handling via the FacesServlet. A somewhat older usage is to use servlets in conjunction with JSPs in a pattern called
                            "Model 2", which is a flavor of the model–view–controller.

                            JavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients.
                            JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters <% and %>. A JSP is compiled to a Java servlet, a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.
                            <br>
                            Jakarta Server Pages (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages) is a collection of technologies that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems,
                            JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but uses the Java programming language.
                            To deploy and run Jakarta Server Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required.

                            which have Java running on the UI to back server end.

                            Maven, created by Jason van Zyl, began as a sub-project of Apache Turbine in 2002. In 2003, it was voted on and accepted as a top level Apache Software Foundation project.<br>
                            Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Honestly, Maven is great. If you’ve never used Maven before,
                            you’re missing out. Sometimes, I wonder how it was even possible to create enterprise applications prior
                            to its creation.
                            <br><br>
                            Maven can manage all your project dependencies, configurations and build configurations and even documentation only by specifying
                            them in a single pom.xml file.
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation,
                            where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project.<br><br>
                            Maven addresses two aspects of building software: how software is built, and its dependencies. Unlike earlier tools like Apache Ant, it uses conventions for the build procedure, and only exceptions need to be written down. An XML file describes the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. It comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging. Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository, and stores them in a local cache.<br>
                            This local cache of downloaded artifacts can also be updated with artifacts created by local projects. Public repositories can also be updated.<br>
                            <br>

                            As we know the primitive types of Java are the basic types : byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean. These types cannot be used as objects or as type parameters to generic types, which means that many general-purpose utilities cannot be applied to them. Guava provides a number of these general-purpose utilities, ways of interfacing between primitive arrays and collection APIs, conversion from types to byte array representations,
                            and support for unsigned behaviors on certain types.

                    <h4> 7) Hibernate-ORM</h4>

                    <p class="lead">
                        <b>
                            <strong>ORM</strong>
                            <br>
                            ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc.
                            <br>
                            <strong> JPA</strong>
                            <br>
                            The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification of Java. It is used to persist data between Java object and relational database. JPA acts as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems.
                            <br>
                            As JPA is just a specification, it doesn't perform any operation by itself. It requires an implementation. So, ORM tools like Hibernate, TopLink and iBatis implements JPA specifications for data persistence.
                            <br>
                            <strong> Hibernate-ORM</strong><br>
                            Hibernate-ORM is an object relational mapper. It’s used for persisting of data in relational databases. It provides an easier and more abstract way of doing that for the developers. It uses JDBC in its implementation.
                            Hibernate is also an implementation of the JPA specification.
                            <br>
                            <strong>- </strong>Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for JAVA. It is an open source persistent framework created by Gavin King in 2001. It is a powerful, high performance Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for any Java Application.
                            <br>
                            <strong>- </strong>Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and from Java data types to SQL data types and relieves the developer from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks.
                            <br>
                            <strong>- </strong>Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.
                            <br>
                            <strong>- </strong>Hibernate enables you to develop persistent classes following natural Object-oriented idioms including inheritance, polymorphism, association, composition, and the Java collections framework. Hibernate requires no interfaces or base classes for persistent classes and enables any class or data
                            structure to be persistent.
                            Hibernate supports lazy initialization, numerous fetching strategies and optimistic locking with automatic versioning and time stamping. Hibernate requires no special database tables or fields and generates much of the SQL at system initialization time instead of at runtime.
                            <br>
                            <strong>- </strong>Hibernate consistently offers superior performance over straight JDBC code, both in terms of developer productivity and runtime performance.
