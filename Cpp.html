                            C++
                            is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
                            <br>
                            C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
                            <br>
                            C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,
                            including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
                            <br>
                            C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).

                    <p class="lead">
                        <b>
                            In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.<br>
                            The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis.<br> Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development.
                            <br>When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.
                            C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
                            <br>
                            Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.
                            In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.
                            <br>
                            On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, "for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language".
                            As of 2021 C++ ranked fourth on the <a href="https:wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index" title="TIOBE index">TIOBE index</a>, a measure of the popularity of programming languages, after <a href="/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a>, <a href="/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" title="Python (programming language)">Python</a>.

                                C++ has a ton of developers that use it, upgrade it, and write open-source libraries. While learning or using the language, you can draw on the work already done by these people.

                                <strong>Memory unsafe</strong> <br>
                                Since C++ offers manual memory management, it is also memory unsafe. This introduces a specific class of bugs called undefined behavior—unpredictable actions that are caused by doing actions that are not a part of the language, for example, accessing the 10th element of a 5 element array.

                                Since C++ is closer to C than high-level languages, the code is rather detailed. Therefore, it can be hard for developers to orient in large projects.

                                It is reasonably faster to use high-level languages like Java and Python for creating applications. Therefore, if performance is not extremely important, it makes more sense to develop in a high-level language – you’ll get there faster.

                            As we have said before, these languages are quite similar. C++ is a superset of C, which means that it is C with extra features. Therefore, every valid C program is a valid C++ program. So why wouldn’t developers choose to use C++ instead of C? There are a few reasons.

                                Rust is a bit of a newcomer to the arena of low-level programming languages. Instead of using manual memory allocation, its compiler analyzes your memory management and rejects programs that could cause problems somewhere down the line. Therefore, it is much safer to use
                                than C++.

                                In addition, Rust is a newer language that is not encumbered by decades of history and legacy code that it needs to support. Therefore, it can add modern features much more quickly and support
                                them better.

                                But don’t get convinced so quickly. Because Rust is so new, it lacks a lot of libraries and ecosystem support for a lot of tasks that C++ is good for. In addition, modern C++ has a lot of tooling that can help escape its downfalls,
                                and it is getting better every year.

                                This category includes all the different programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and most of the other programming languages that are usually discussed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                C++ is always faster than these languages since it doesn’t use a garbage collector. While in C++, you manage your own memory manually, garbage-collected languages do that for you. It usually comes with a performance downside because the program has to stop at some time and garbage collect, making the performance unpredictable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This is unacceptable in games or operating systems. Imagine if your game or operating system became slower for random periods of time—that wouldn’t really be the best experience.

                                But, in contrast, the code in high-level languages is <em>faster to write in</em>. Therefore, for things like web apps, we optimize for the fastest time to develop, release, and test the app, rather than focus on small performance benefits. Afterward, it is possible to rewrite parts of the app in C++ to scale.
