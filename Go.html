                            Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It was initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is strongly and statically typed, provides inbuilt support for garbage collection, and supports concurrent programming.
                            <br>
                            Programs are constructed using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to generate executable binaries. The Go programming language was announced in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.

                            <li>
                                The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics:<br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>static typing and run-time efficiency (like C),</li>
                                    <li>readability and usability (like Python or JavaScript),</li>

                            <li>The designers were primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++.</li>
                            <li>Go was publicly announced in November 2009,and version 1.0 was released in March 2012.</li>
                            <li> Go is widely used in production at Google and in many other organizations and open-source projects. </li>
                            <li>In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts were released by type designers Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes specifically for use by the Go project. Go is a humanist sans-serif which resembles Lucida Grande and Go Mono is monospaced. Each of the fonts adhere to the WGL4 character set and were designed to be legible with a large x-height and distinct letterforms. </li>
                            <li>Go and Go Mono adhere to the DIN 1450 standard by having a slashed zero, lowercase l with a tail, and an uppercase I with serifs.</li>
                            <li>In April 2018, the original logo was replaced with a stylized GO slanting right with trailing streamlines. However, the Gopher mascot remained the same.</li>

                        <b>
                            The GoLang was reportedly conceived by developers at Google when they were waiting for the code compilation to complete in a project.
                            This is precisely why GoLang is the only language that incorporates all three sought-after capabilities, namely, ease of coding, efficient code-compilation and efficient execution. Bringing all these capabilities in one language is what made GoLang so special.<br>
                            Go or GoLang, as it is called, is a robust system-level language used for programming across large-scale network servers and big distributed systems.
                            <a href="https://www.educba.com/c-plus-plus-vs-go/"> Golang emerged as an alternative to C++</a>and Java for the app developers in the context of what Google needed for its network servers and distributed systems.<br>
                            The language was created to do away with the lack of pace and difficulties involved with programming for large and scalable servers and software systems. To be precise, at Google, Go came to offer the following solutions.
                            <br>
                            • Fast-paving compilation and execution.
                            <br>
                            • Do away with the need of working with different subsets of languages for one project.
                            <br>
                            • A boost to code readability and documentation.
                            <br>
                            • Offering a thoroughly consistent language.
                            <br>
                            • Facilitating easy versioning of the program.
                            <br>
                            • Allowing developing with multiple languages.
                            <br>
                            • Allowing easier maintenance of dependencies.

                            Go has the same performance as C, but it is much easier to maintain than Java. Without the need for a virtual machine, Go boasts easier maintenance and no warming up period.

                                <li><strong>Its speed: </strong>Because Golang is a compiled language, any code written within Go actively compiles into a format the processor understands. Other languages such as Java are compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the virtual machine. Go enhances the availability and reliability of services as it has been<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/go.html"> proven</a> to be faster than other languages such as Java or Python.</li>
                                <li><strong>Golang is easy to grasp: </strong>Due to its same procedural approach, it is easy for software developers to familiarize themselves with Go, particularly if they have a foundation in C or Java.</li>
                                <li><strong>Golang is fully concurrent and more stable: </strong>Golang has Goroutines that take up as little as 2kB of memory. These basic functions can run simultaneously and independently, making multiple processes possible when the need arises. Unlike Java threads that consume large amounts of memory, Goroutines, which are used instead of threads, require much less RAM lowering the risk of crashing due to lack of memory.</li>
                                <li>This also allows for older devices to enjoy Go-based apps due to the simple fact that they have less demanding system requirements.</li>

                                    being introduced in 2009, Golang is still a fairly new language. It’s lack of
                                    SDK and 3rd party interfaces often burden programmers with having to write
                                    extra code to combine multiple programs. Furthermore, because Go doesn’t have
                                    its own GUI library, programmers may struggle and require a fair amount of
                                    knowledge, especially when interfacing with other platforms.

                                    handles collects and input processes it, and then returns an output is known as
                                    a function. While a group of different functions with the same name but have no
                                    defined type during the compile time are known as generic functions. Golang’s
                                    lack of support for generic functions forces programmers to code multiple
                                    footprints of functions to handle various parameters. This lack of support
                                    severely decreases efficiency during development due to a lack of code

                            <li>Vegeta is a versatile HTTP load testing tool built out of a need to drill HTTP services with a constant request rate. It can be used both as a command line utility and a library.</li>
                            <li>vegeta, a HTTP load testing tool and library, was clearly created by a DBZ fan.</li>
                            <li> it’s designed to test HTTP services with a constant request rate. Presumably, they decided to name it after a Saiyan prince for its attack functions (both targeted and distributed) as a load tester. </li>
                            <li> Vegeta is great if you want your program to get a good workout and analyze any weak points.</li>
                            <li>Vegeta is a go-lang binary (and library) so installing and using it is a breeze. There are not many concepts to understand and learn.</li>
                            <li>The best thing about Vegeta is there is no need to install python or Java to get started. Next, let’s install Vegeta to begin Vegeta load testing.</li>

                            <li>This dependency-free Go library is meant to help match fuzzy strings. In particular, fuzzy is optimized for filenames and code symbols. No worries for what style – fuzzy can parse Sublime Text, VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA and more.</li>
                            <li>fuzzy provides speedy, intuitive matching. Within milliseconds, fuzzy can match strings and even determine quality matches based on its own internal logic. </li>
                            <li> It does this by looking at the first character in the match string, as well as seeing if the matched character is camel cased, follows a separator like an underscore, or even if it’s adjacent to a previous match. Importantly, fuzzy is even Unicode aware.</li>
                            <li>This library is external dependency-free. It only depends on the Go standard library.</li>
