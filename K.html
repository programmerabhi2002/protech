                            Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,
                            but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript
                            or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.
                            Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.
                            <br>
                            On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers. As a result many developers have switched to Kotlin.
                            Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler targets Java 6 by default, but lets the programmer choose to target Java 8 up to 13, for optimization,
                            or more features.

                                In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM, which had been under development for a year.
                                etBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compilation time of Scala as a deficiency.

                            <li>
                                One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java. In February 2012, JetBrains open sourced the project under the Apache 2 license.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. Andrey Breslav mentioned that the team decided to name it after an island, just like Java was named after the Indonesian island of Java
                                though the programming language Java was perhaps named after the coffee.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                JetBrains hopes that the new language will drive IntelliJ IDEA sales.

                                Kotlin v1.0 was released on February 15, 2016.his is considered to be the first officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version.

                                At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android.
                                Kotlin v1.2 was released on November 28, 2017.Sharing code between JVM and JavaScript platforms feature was newly added to this release (as of version 1.4 multiplatform programming is an alpha feature
                                upgraded from "experimental"). A full-stack demo has been made with the new Kotlin/JS Gradle Plugin.

                            <h3>Difference Between Kotlin and JAVA</h3>

                            <p>Both are popular choices in the market; let us discuss some of the major differences:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Kotlin has the support of smart cast which identifies immutable types and performs implicit cast by compiler whereas in Java we need to identify and perform the casting.</li>
                                <li>Kotlin has the support of type inference which means we don’t need to specify the data type of variable explicitly whereas in Java we need to specify explicitly.</li>
                                <li>In Kotlin, we don’t have checked exceptions, which is a disadvantage as it leads to error prone-code whereas Java has support for checked exceptions by which we can perform error handling.</li>
                                <li>Java compilation time is 15-20% faster than Kotlin compilation time but in perspective of incremental build compilation, Kotlin will also take same compilation time as Java.</li>
                                <li>In Kotlin, we can’t assign null values to variables or return values, if we really want to assign then we can declare a variable with special syntax whereas in Java we can assign null values but when we try to access objects pointing to null values raises an exception.</li>
                                <li>Kotlin is interchangeable with Java irrespective of difference between Java vs Kotlin. We can call Kotlin code in Java and Java code in Kotlin. So we can have both Java vs Kotlin classes side by side in a project and compiles without any issues. After compilation we unable to find which class written in Java or Kotlin.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="adk">Advantages and Disadvantages of Kotlin</h3>

                            <h4><strong>Advantages of Kotlin </strong></h4>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Maximize the productivity</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Kotlin is a programing language that is based on Java. Kotlin can easily get rid of aggravations as well as obsolescence of Java. Kotlin is a clear compact and dynamic language. Kotlin can maximize the productivity of the developer’s team as it takes very little time to write and also you can deploy it pretty fast.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Works with existing Java Code</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Kotlin is interoperable with Java codes. Kotlin is persistent with Java and so many other related frameworks and tools. So switching to Kotlin is much easy. If the product you are building can’t only be written in Kotlin, you can use the other one and both can be used together easily.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Can be easily maintained</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Kotlin is supported by many IDEs which also include Android Studio and so many other SDK tools. By this, it also can maximize the productivity of the developer as it can continuously deal with toolkits they are already using.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Less Buggy</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>As we know Kotlin is a clear and compact codebase so it does not leave any space for making any mistakes, it also helps to provide more stable codes in production. The compiler will identify every possible mistake at a compile-time span sans any tumult.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Reliable</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>So many programming languages are available out there but Kotlin is more sophisticated language among them. Kotlin came on the big screen in the year of 2011. Till the time it has been introduced Kotlin has undergone many Beta and Alfa stages prior to releasing its final version.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Easy to learn</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Kotlin aims to enhance the features of Java not just rewrite them. Mobile developers who have worked on Java they also can use Kotlin easily and their skill on Java will also stay relevant and helpful on Kotlin.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>merges fuctional and procedural programming</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Nowadays so many programming languages are available in the market and everyone has their fair share of advantages and disadvantages. In order to get the best results Kotlin has combined the best of the functional as well as procedural programming.</p>

                            <h4><strong>Disadvantages of Kotlin</strong></h4>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Different from Java</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Though Kotlin and Java have too many resemblances but still, there are some differences too. App developers just can’t make the switch if they have inadequate knowledge about Kotlin.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Compilation Speed</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In some cases, Kotlin works even faster than Java while performing incremental builds. But it should be remembered that Java will still stay incomparable when we talk about clean building.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Less Kotlin professionals</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Kotlin has the sky-high popularity in developers community still only few programmers are available in this field. The fact about Kotlin is developers need to have in-depth knowledge about this language but nowadays it is really hard to find experienced experts in the domain of Kotlin.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Limited sources to learn</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The number of developers who are switching to Kotlin is increasing but there are only limited developers community available to learn this language from or solve quarries in the process of development.</p>

                        <h3>Some popular Kotlin Libraries</h3><br>

                        <b>
                            <strong>1. Kotlin Coroutines</strong>
                            <br>

                            <p>Some of the APIs embark on long-running operations that include IO, CPU, file IO, or GPU-intensive work and require a caller to block until they come to an end. But with Kotlin Coroutines, things are quite different. This helps to shun blocking thread and replaces it with the more convenient operation known as suspension of coroutines. Kotlin Coroutines enable developers to develop asynchronous programs in a simpler way, which are primarily based on the concept of continuation-passing style programming.</p>

                            </center>

                            <strong>2. FlexboxLayout</strong>

                            <br>
                            <p>If you want to develop flexible layouts in your application, then FlexboxLayout is an amazing Android layout manager that can help you bring the analogous capabilities to the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module. This feature has extended the ViewGroup similar to Android linear layout and relative layout. You can also add different layouts to Flexbox such as flexWrap, flexDirection, justifyContent, alignItems, and alignContent. While using this layout you can arrange items in a horizontal manner and for step, you’ll be shifted to the next line.</p>

                            <strong>3. Anko</strong>

                            <br>
                            <p>This is one of the popular Android libraries as it is written in Kotlin but maintained by JetBrains. The goal of this library is to speed-up the Kotlin Android development process, which makes it convenient as compared to other libraries. Anko has got its names from the first two letters of (An)droid and (Ko)tlin, naming it Anko. In addition, the library has four diverse modules that include Layouts, SQLite, Commons, and Coroutines.</p>

                            </center>

                            <strong>4. RxKotlin</strong>

                            <p>This is the most lightweight library as compared to all the above-mentioned Android libraries because it adds convenient extension functions to RxJava, which allows you to utilize RxJava and Kotlin exceptionally. Although Kotlin has language features like extension functions that help to simplify the usage of RxJava even more. RxKotlin assists in gathering all these conveniences into one centralized library and standardize conventions for using RxJava with Kotlin.</p>

                            </center>

                            <strong>5. KBinding</strong>

                            <br>

                            <p>As the name suggests, KBinding is the data binding library for Kotlin, which is widely used with Anko to allow data binding seamlessly and comprehensively to understand the syntax. This library enables you to bind the data of your models straight to the XML views in a very flawless way. It represents four data binding models, which are as follows:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>OneWay: Binding from model to view</li>
                                <li>TwoWay: Binding from model to view and view to model</li>
                                <li>OneTime: Binding from model to view and auto-release after first emit</li>
                                <li>OneWayToSource: Binding from view to model</li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>6. Ktlint</strong>
                            <br>
                            <p>We always advise you to focus on what matters and adds value to the business rather than spending time on non-revenue generating tasks. Ktlint library includes both linear and formatted as it is a single binary, in which, it tries to capture the code from Android Kotlin Guide Style and kotlinlang.org. With this library, you can put over the importance of code clarity and community conventions than preferences. This will make things quite easy for people who are reading your codes, freeing up your time spent documenting everything.</p>

                            <strong>7. Klaxon</strong>
                            <br>
                            <p>This is also a lightweight library that helps you parse JSON in Kotlin. In this library, the values are parsed from a suitable JSON file to the following type:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Long</li>
                                        <li>Int</li>
                                        <li>String</li>
                                        <li>Double</li>
                                        <li>JsonObject</li>
                                        <li>JsonArray</li>
                                        <li>Boolean</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
